## üìå Overview

**SAFE TURN** is an intelligent traffic safety system designed to prevent accidents on dangerous blind curves and narrow roads. The system uses two strategically placed ESP32 devices equipped with TF-Luna LiDAR sensors to detect approaching vehicles and provide early warnings to drivers on the opposite side of the curve.

### How It Works
1. **Vehicle Detection**: LiDAR sensors detect approaching vehicles within the configurable range
2. **Speed Calculation**: The system calculates vehicle speed in real-time using distance measurements
3. **Wireless Communication**: ESP-NOW protocol transmits warning signals instantly between devices
4. **Visual Feedback**: OLED displays show system status and detected vehicle speeds
5. **Warning Activation**: Relay-controlled warning lights/sirens alert drivers of incoming traffic

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Distance and Detection Settings
```cpp
#define DISTANCE_THRESHOLD 1.0      // Trigger distance (meters)
#define MAX_DETECT_RANGE 1.0        // Maximum detection range (meters)
```

### Timing Configuration
```cpp
#define RELAY_ON_DURATION 3000      // Warning duration (milliseconds)
#define RETRY_DELAY 100             // Communication retry delay (ms)
```

### Communication Settings
```cpp
#define CHANNEL 1                   // ESP-NOW channel
#define MAX_RETRIES 1               // Maximum transmission attempts

### Device MAC Addresses
Update these addresses in the code to match your ESP32 devices:
```cpp
// Device 1 broadcasts to Device 2
uint8_t broadcastAddress[] = {0xF4, 0x65, 0x0B, 0x48, 0x85, 0xB0};

// Device 2 broadcasts to Device 1  
uint8_t broadcastAddress[] = {0xF4, 0x65, 0x0B, 0x46, 0xF7, 0xE4};

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. **Arduino IDE** with ESP32 board package installed
2. Required libraries:
   - `Wire.h` (included with Arduino IDE)
   - `WiFi.h` (included with ESP32 package)
   - `esp_now.h` (included with ESP32 package)
   - `U8g2lib.h` - [Install from Library Manager](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2)
   - `TFLI2C.h` - [Download from Benewake](https://github.com/budryerson/TFLuna-I2C)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Install required libraries** in Arduino IDE

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  Serial.print("MAC Address: ");
  Serial.println(WiFi.macAddress());
}
void loop() {}

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No communication between devices:**
- Verify MAC addresses are correctly configured
- Check ESP-NOW initialization in serial monitor
- Ensure both devices are powered and within range

**Inaccurate speed readings:**
- Calibrate LiDAR sensors for your installation height
- Adjust `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD` for your curve geometry
- Check I2C connections and addresses

**Relay not activating:**
- Verify relay module power requirements
- Check relay pin connections (default: pin 5)
- Test relay manually with digitalWrite commands

**Display issues:**
- Confirm OLED I2C address (usually 0x3C or 0x3F)
- Check SDA/SCL connections
- Verify display power supply voltage
